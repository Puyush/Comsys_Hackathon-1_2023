üìå Round 1:

In the first round, our primary focus was on developing two key models:

Sentimental Classification Model: Our team designed a robust model capable of classifying sentiment in text data. This model was created to extract valuable insights from textual data and provide accurate sentiment analysis. We need to Classify tweets into 5 different mental health-related categories. It can help people gain self-awareness about their mental health.

Transfer Value Prediction Model: Alongside sentiment analysis, we built a predictive model for transfer value. This is important to assess the value of a player so that clubs can balance their budgets and build a competitive squad, while getting max return on investment and identifying undervalued talents.

üìå Round 2:

Shifting our focus in the second round, we delved into the intricate world of Time Series Analysis:

Time Series Analysis: Our team engaged in the detailed examination of temporal data, exploring the dynamics of time-dependent datasets. This involved analyzing patterns, identifying trends, and detecting anomalies within time series data, offering valuable insights. The dataset contains monthly carbon dioxide concentration levels from 1986 till 2048 (hypothetical). We're required to predict the monthly carbon dioxide levels for the next 24 months.
